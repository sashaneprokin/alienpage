      <dt><b>Alien:</b></dt>
      <dd>Alien is a word that has long been used to refer to something foreign,<br>
         But when did it become the go-to term for a being from another planet?<br>
         The first person to use alien this way was probably Victorian historian<br>
         And essayist Thomas Carlyle, who at one point during his life,<br>
         Left behind his literati lifestyle to serve as a tutor to a farmer's son in Yorkshire.<br>
         In a letter to a friend, Carlyle is deliberately (and amusingly) melodramatic<br>
         About life in York and his inability to fit in amongst his new neighbors,<br>
         "I am like a being thrown from another planet on this dark terrestrial ball,<br>
         "he wrote, "an alien, a pilgrim among its possessors." In science fiction,<br>
         "alien" isn't used as a catch-all term for extraterrestrial beings until 1929,<br>
         When Science Wonder Stories published Jack Williamson's story The Alien Intelligence.<br>
         It didn't necessarily catch on right away; many sources cite the first use of "alien"<br>
         For extraterrestrial beings in science fiction as Philip Barshofsky's 1934 story One Prehistoric Night,<br>
         Which refers to Martians as aliens. It would certainly be an auspicious introduction for the word;<br>
         The story involves Martians traveling to prehistoric Earth to battle dinosaurs.</dd><hr>
        <dt><b>Android:</b></dt>
        <dd>Long before the invention of the word "robot," humans dreamed of mechanical beings.<br>
           Clockwork artisans would construct all manner of automata—birds that flap their wings,<br>
           Monks that shuffle in silent prayer, dolls that pretend to serve tea or play the dulcimer.<br>
           Naturally, legends popped up about automata that could do incredible—for the time available,<br>
           Impossible—things. One of those legends surrounded the 13th-century Catholic saint Albertus Magnus,<br>
           Who was supposed to have built a mechanical head that could answer the questions posed to it.<br>
           When Ephraim Chambers wrote his 1728 Cyclopædia, he paired the Greek prefix for "man" ("andr-")<br>
           With the suffix for "having the form or likeness of" ("-oid") when describing Albertus Magnus'<br>
           Mythical construct, dubbing it an "androides." By the 19th century, the word was well in vogue,<br>
           Used in patent applications for human-shaped automata. Lucasfilm holds the trademark <br>
           On the shortened form of the word "droid"; the first instance of that form of the word may be<br>
           In Mari Wolf's 1952 story Robots of the World! Arise!—but it never got a toy line.</dd><hr>
        <dt><b>Ansible:</b></dt>
        <dd>Ursula K. Le Guin coined this word for a device for instantaneous communication across<br>
            The vast distances of space in her 1966 novel Rocannon's World. She used it in her later works<br>
            And soon it spread across the works of other science fiction authors as well.<br>
            But where does the word come from? A 2001 Usenet post by Dave Goldman<br>
            Claims that Le Guin told him "ansible" comes from the word "answerable"<br>
            And that she was amused to learn that word is also an anagram for "lesbian."</dd><hr>
        <dt><b>Beam:</b></dt>
        <dd>While the word "beam" evokes visions of Captain Kirk saying,<br>
           "Beam me up, Scotty," beam already refers to the transport of matter<br>
            In the "Matter Transmitter" entry in the 1951 Dictionary of Science Fiction.<br>
           "Beamed" is used as a verb to describe how matter transmitters work in stories<br>
           Like A. E. van Vogt's The Story of Null-A and The Last Spaceship by Murray Leinster<br>
           (a story filled with fighting-beam, pain-beams, and all other manner of beams),<br>
           But neither of those stories themselves use "beam" as a verb. It's an example of a term<br>
           Coming about not from science fiction itself, but from descriptions of science fiction.</dd><hr>
        <dt><b>Blaster:</b></dt>
        <dd>Who shot a blaster first? The (rather mysterious) writer Nictzin Dyalhis<br>
          is believed to have first referred to a scifi gun as a "blastor" (with an "o")<br>
          in When the Green Star Waned, an early entry into the space opera genre, published in Weird Tales in 1925:</dd>
          <blockquote cite="http://http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?58099">
          Well it was for me that, in obedience to Hul Jok's imperative command,<br>
          I was holding my Blastor pointing ahead of me; for as I blundered full upon<br>
          The monstrosity it upheaved its ugly bulk—how I do not know, for I saw no legs<br>
          Nor did it have wings—to one edge and would have flopped down upon me, but instinctively<br>
          I slid forward the catch on the tiny Blastor, and the foul thing vanished—save for a few fragments<br>
          Of its edges—smitten into nothingness by the vibration hurled forth from that powerful little disintegrator.<br>
          </blockquote><hr>
        <dt><b>Credit:</b></dt>
        <dd>The universe's most generic form of currency first shows up John W. Campbell's The Mightiest Machine,<br>
           Which was serialized in Astounding starting in December 1934 and stars Campbell's recurring character Aarn Munro,<br>
           When one character complains about having to build "a five-million-credit flying laboratory." Later,<br>
           The same character proposes naming a rocketship "Little credit-eater"<br>
           After the hull alone costs him a jaw-dropping two and a half million credits.<dd><hr>
          <dt><b>CyberSpace:</b></dt>
          <dd>"Cyberspace" is one of those words that has quickly traveled from science fiction into the mainstream vernacular.<br>
              The word comes, not surprisingly, from that cyberpunk master William Gibson, appearing first in his 1982 short story Burning Chrome.<br>
              (Gibson actually first read the story aloud in 1981, but it wasn't published in Omni until the following year.)Cyberspace.<br>
              A con sensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation,<br>
              By children being taught mathematical concepts . . . A graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system.<br>
              Unthinkable complexity. Lines of light ranged in the non space of the mind, clusters and constellations of data. Like city lights, receding....</dd>
