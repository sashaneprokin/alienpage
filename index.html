      <h2>Does Extraterrestrial exists?
      <h3>That’s a question everyone would like answered. Here’s why:</h3>
        <p>The Milky Way is huge. Best estimates put it at around 100,000 light years across and it might be even a bit larger.
          There are, by most estimates, about 100 billion planets in our galaxy. Even if we estimate that only 1% of them are Earth-like planets, that’s still about a billion planets possibly capable of supporting life as we know it.
          But they are so very far apart.</p>
        <p>Here’s an analogy of the distances involved: if the Sun was about the size of a basketball,
          placed right on the edge of the eastern coastline of Florida, and the Earth a little smaller
          than the size of a BB placed about 93 feet away from the basketball-Sun, then our closest stellar neighbor,
          the Alpha Centauri system, would be somewhere in California. (real distance about 2500 miles)
          Look carefully at that little BB. Imagine microscopic bacteria crawling all over it.
          That’s life on Earth, including us, the human species. Now turn toward California and imagine
          those microscopic organisms trying to reach California, either with spaceships or radio.
          And everything in between those two points, the BB in Florida and the Centauri system in California, is empty.
          Imagine trying to call California. Just saying hello would take four years for the message to reach Cal.
          The answer would take another four years to come back.</p>
        <p>When astronomers peer out into the sky, looking for new planets,
          it takes a very specialized form of astronomy to determine if the star even has planets.
           Never mind the techniques; we’ve found only a handful of Earth-like planets so far and even those are pretty iffy.
           Yes, it’s possible that another civilization like ours—or even really different—may be trying to do the same thing.
           But: space is vast. Bigger than we can conceive, even with the analogy I mentioned.
           We could be looking right at a star with a planet that has life similar to ours
           and we’d never know unless they happened to be looking at us and
           signaled us at exactly the same time we happened to be looking at them. What are the odds?</p>
          <p>Pretty bad, actually. The Drake equation—see the other answers on this thread—indicates
            that there should be many civilizations in this galaxy. But, for them to contact us,
            they’d have to be extremely advanced. If they are, then they wouldn’t necessarily want to talk to us anyway.
            Do you want to talk to those microscopic bacteria crawling all over that BB? It would be a rather boring conversation I think.</p>
          <p>The chances are pretty good that there are other inhabited planets with fairly advanced civilizations in the Milky Way.
            Here’s the catch: there is also an equally likely chance that those civilizations are nowhere near as advanced as us.
            In fact, it’s quite possible that we may be among the first.
            It’s also quite possible that there may have been many civilizations that have already risen, hit their peak, and then died off, for one reason or another.</p>
          <p>We don’t know. In fact, we may never know. We may be like those possible civilizations that rose, peaked,
            and fell without ever contacting another living world in the whole of their existence. Depressing, isn’t it? So here is my suggestion to you.</p>
          <p>Go to school. Study science and technology, physics, math,
            anything that helps increase the possibilities of communication with anyone or anything Out There.
            Try to break the Rule: most civilizations might never contact another. Do something unique.
            Think outside the box; in fact, get rid of the box altogether and think in ways that have never been attempted.
            But stay smart and scientific. Don’t trade reality for fantasy and imagine that every light in the sky is an alien spacecraft visiting us.
            Instead, figure out a way to build spacecraft of our own to go Out There and find those aliens. It’s worth doing.</p><br>
